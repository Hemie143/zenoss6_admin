Cause: The maximum hop count was exceeded for this message. This non-delivery report can also be caused if a looping condition exists between sending and receiving servers that are not in the same Exchange organization. In this situation, the message bounces back and forth until the hop count is exceeded. A configuration error in the e-mail system can also cause the message to bounce between two servers or to be forwarded between two recipients. Solution: The maximum hop count is a property set on each virtual server and you can manually override it. The default maximum hop count is 15. Also, check for any situations that might cause loops between servers.'

Cause: The maximum hop count was exceeded for this message. This non-delivery report can also be caused if a looping condition exists between sending and receiving servers that are not in the same Exchange organization. In this situation, the message bounces back and forth until the hop count is exceeded.

          This trap will be sent any time the status of a logical
          adapter changes to the Failed condition.  This occurs
          when the adapter in a single adapter configuration fails,
          or when the last adapter in a redundant configuration fails.
          
          This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
          removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
          adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this

        example: snmp trap cpqSmAlertDestinationBlacklisted
        evaluation: |+
          Alert destination blacklisted.
          
          The Server Manager board modem has blacklisted an alert 
          destination phone number.  Once blacklisted, that alert 
          destination is no longer available for use as an alert 
          destination.  Blacklisting, which only occurs in 
          international modems, is a requirement imposed by certain 
          European countries on modems, to prevent a phone number 
          from being dialed multiple times without getting a connection.  
          The number of attempts required to have blacklisting occur,
           vary from country to country.  Once an alert destination has 
           been blacklisted, the only way to remove the blacklisted phone 
           number is to remove power from the modem.  
           On external modems this is a trival task.  When a blacklisting
           occurs on the Server Manager board's internal modem the
           task is slightly more difficult as the modem gets power 
           from the Server Manager board.  
           To remove power from the Server Manager board's internal modem,
           the Server Manager board must be forced into Dormant Mode.
           This is an operating mode, used to conserve battery life,
           which is entered automatically if the board looses power.
           To cause the board to enter Dormant Mode, the following
           steps should be performed:
             1) Disable alerting via CPQCAUI.NLM.
             2) Disable async communication via CPQCAUI.NLM.
             3) Down the server.
             4) Exit to DOS (if applicable).
             5) Shut power off to the computer.
             6) Wait 5 minutes before restoring power.
           Once the 5 minutes has expired, and power to the computer
           has been restored, the modem will have flushed its
           blacklist, and the board's alerting functions will work
           as expected.
