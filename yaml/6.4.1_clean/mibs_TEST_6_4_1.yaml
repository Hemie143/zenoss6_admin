            The MAC address used by this bridge when it must
            be referred to in a unique fashion.   It is
            recommended that this be the numerically smallest
            MAC address of all ports that belong to this
            bridge.  However it is only required to be unique.
            When concatenated with dot1dStpPriority a unique
            BridgeIdentifier is formed which is used in the
            Spanning Tree Protocol.

            For a port which (potentially) has the same value
            of dot1dBasePortIfIndex as another port on the
            same bridge, this object contains the name of an
            object instance unique to this port.  For example,
            in the case where multiple ports correspond one-
            to-one with multiple X.25 virtual circuits, this
            value might identify an (e.g., the first) object
            instance associated with the X.25 virtual circuit
            corresponding to this port.
            
            For a port which has a unique value of
            dot1dBasePortIfIndex, this object can have the
            value { 0 0 }.

            1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9
            through 16, etc.  Within each octet, the most
            significant bit represents the lowest numbered

          Configuration management MIB.
          
          The MIB represents a model of configuration data that
          exists in various locations:
          
          running       in use by the running system
          terminal      saved to whatever is attached as the terminal
          local         saved locally in NVRAM or flash
          remote        saved to some server on the network
          
          Although some of the system functions that relate here
          can be used for general file storage and transfer, this
          MIB intends to include only such operations as clearly
          relate to configuration.  Its primary emphasis is to
          track changes and saves of the running configuration.
          
          As saved data moves further from startup use, such as
          into different local flash files or onto the network,
          tracking becomes difficult to impossible, so the MIB's
          interest and functions are confined in that area.
          
          Information from ccmCLIHistoryCommandTable can be used
          to track the exact configuration changes that took
          place within a particular Configuration History
          event. NMS' can use this information to update
          the related components.
          For example:
              If commands related only to MPLS are entered
              then the NMS need to update only the MPLS related
              management information rather than updating
              all of its management information.

            What constitutes a safe saving of the running
            configuration is a management policy issue beyond the
            scope of this MIB.  For some installations, writing the
            running configuration to a terminal may be a way of
            capturing and saving it.  Others may use local or
            remote storage.  Thus ANY write is considered saving
            for the purposes of the MIB.

          The MIB for managing Server Load Balancing
          Manager(s), and products supporting Server
          Load Balancing(SLB) features.
          
          This MIB extends the tables(as appropriate)
          that  are defined in CISCO-SLB-MIB  and
          CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB.
          Some of the functionalities supported are:
             * Real Server Configuration with real server
               identified by a name
             * Real Server configuration in a Server Farm.
             * Health Probe Configuration in a real server.
             * Sticky Configuration for HTTP Header, HTTP Cookie
               and Client IP Address, SSL(Secure Socket Layer).
          
          Acronyms and terminology:
          
          SLB       : Server Load Balancing
                      When a client initiates a connection to
                      virtual server, the system load balances
                      the connection to the chosen real server
                      based on the user configuration.
                      SLB is important for Scaling of Web
                      Services and for traditional serverices
                      such as DNS, FTP etc.
          Server Farm    : Contains cluster of Real Server
          Virtual Server : Group of Real Servers
          RServer                   : RServers are physical devices that
                                           do not belong to any server farm.
          Real Server    : Real Servers are physical devices
                           assigned to a server farms.
                           Real  servers provide services that
                           are load balanced.
          Health Probe   : The mechanisms to monitor the health
                           of real servers.
          sticky ConnectIons : Sticky connections limit traffic
                      to the individual real servers by allowing
                      multiple connections from the same client
                      to stick (or attach) to the same real
                      server using source IP addresses,
                      source IP subnets, cookies, and the
                      secure socket layer (SSL) or by
                      redirecting these connections using
                      Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                      redirect messages. Sticky connection
                      feature also permits coupling of the
                      services that are handled by more
                      than one virtual server.
          cookie : A cookie is a small data structure used by a
                   server to deliver data to a Web client and
                   request that the client store the information.
                   In certain applications, the client returns
                   the information to the server to maintain
                   the state between the client and the server.

            This table lists the power capacity of a power FRU in the

            We can also have what are known as variable power supplies.
            They can provide both system and inline power and can be
            varied within hardware defined ranges for system and inline
            limited by a total maximum combined output. They could be
            configured by the user via CLI or SNMP or be controlled by
            software internally.

            cefcFRUCurrent attribute in that table provides the overall
            current the power supply FRU can provide while this table

          This is the Cisco fibre element management MIB module.
          It covers:
          - Cisco extension to the interface MIB ( IF-MIB )
          - Contains all the groups from FIBRE-CHANNEL-FE-MIB
            relevant to Cisco fabric.
          - Other features specific to Cisco fabric.
          
          This MIB supports all the port types defined by the
          textual convention FcPortTypes. In addition it also
          supports Nx_port, where Nx_port can be either N_port or
          NL_port. The FC standards define Interconnect_Ports
          to be E_ports or B_Ports.
          
          This MIB supports Port Channel ports. Port
          Channel port is a single logical port, which contains
          multiple physical ports as its members. Presently only
          E_ports can be a member of Port Channel port.
          
          In addition it provides GigE and port channel information
          for all the Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) ports in the fabric.

            The object to either enable or disable the trunking
            protocol for the device. The trunking protocol is used
            for negotiating trunk mode and calculating operational
            VSANs on an EISL link. It also performs port VSAN
            consistency checks. On non-trunking ISL links, if the
            port VSANs are different, the E ports will be isolated.
            To avoid this isolation, this MIB variable should be
            set to 'disable(2)'.
            enable(1) - enables trunking protocol.
            disable (2) - disables the trunking protocol.

            operating in Fx mode. Value of

            is 'shared'. Value of fcIfCapFrmRxBbCreditDefault is
            used if fcIfPortRateMode is 'dedicated'.
            Similarly, if the port is operating in inter switch link
            (ISL) mode then the value of the object
            fcIfCapOsmISLRxBbCreditDefault or

            value of this object is used for the port operating
            in either Fx or ISL port mode. But if
            fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeISL is configured with a valid
            value, then the value of fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeISL
            object is used instead of this value, if the port is
            operating in  ISL port mode. Similarly, if
            the values configured for fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeFx
            is valid, then the value of fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeFx
            object is used instead of this value, if the port is
            operating in Fx mode.
            If this object is set to non-zero value then
            objects fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeISL and
            fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeFx are set to zero at that time.
            But later the objects fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeISL and

            This object specifies the ifIndex of a FC tunnel
            that represents a logical Fibre Channel data path
            between a source switch and destination switch.
            RSPAN uses a special FC tunnel that originates
            at the ST port in the source switch and terminates
            at the SD port in the destination switch. The FC
            tunnel must be first bound to an ST port in the source
            switch and then mapped to an SD port in the destination
            switch for RSPAN feature configuration, which enables
            monitoring traffic from a remote switch.
            A value of zero indicates that no FC tunnel is mapped to
            a ST port.

            In certain scenarios, when an interface in a system
            transitions to a down state due to a particular reason, it is
            likely for the interface to keep flapping between up and down
            states continuously. The objects in each entry of this table
            help in controlling such behaviour on an interface by stopping
            such frequent transitions and holding the interface in down
            state, if a stipulated number of such toggles happen in a given
            duration, as described in the objects.
            Per each reason for which the interface flaps, an entry in this
            table can be used to configure the following: whether or not
            the flapping should be controlled on the interface, the allowed
            number of flaps and the allowed duration before the interface
            is held in down state.

            The service state of the interface. Some but not all
            interfaces, e.g., those on hardware modules with a
            capability of supporting shared resources, can have
            their state changed to 'outOfService'. Examples of
            such shared resources include speed/bandwidth and
            buffer memory. Shared resources include the values
            of the following objects:
            
              fcIfAdminSpeed,
              fcIfAdminMode,
              fcIfPortRateMode,
              fcIfAdminRxBbCredit,
              fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeISL,
              fcIfAdminRxBbCreditModeFx,
              fcIfAdminRxBbCreditExtended,
              fcIfAdminRxPerfBuffer.
            
            When an attempt is made to change a particular
            interface's value for this object to 'outOfService':
              - if the interface's ifAdminStatus is 'up' or if the
                interface is a part of a Port channel, then the
                change to the value of this object is rejected.
              - if the interface's value of this object is
                successfully changed to 'outOfService', then each
                and every user-configured parameter value of the
                above-listed shared resource objects for that
                interface is set to its default value.
            
            When an interface is in the 'outOfService' state then:
              - the interface is not operational and no packets
                can be passed,
              - the interface's shared resource objects can not be
                configured to non-default values,
              - the interface cannot be added to a port channel.
              - the interface cannot be involved in a port swap
                (using cficonPortSwapTable in CISCO-FICON-MIB).
              - ifAdminStatus in IF-MIB cannot be changed to 'up'
                state.
              - other interface objects are not affected.
            
            Changing the value of this object on one interface to
            'outOfService' does not affect the functionality of any
            other interface.
            
            When an attempt is made to change a particular interface's
            value for this object to 'inService', the attempt is
            rejected if necessary shared resources are unavailable.

            one entry per FC-port for each active VSAN, from the
            allowed VSAN list for this port.
            The allowed VSAN list is configured using the objects,
            fcIfAllowedVsanList2k and fcIfAllowedVsanList4k.
            If an VSAN becomes inactive then the switch removes the

          This MIB module is for configuration and status query
          of Flex Links feature on the Cisco device.
          
          Flex Links are a pair of Layer 2 interfaces, where one
          interface is configured to act as a backup to the other.
          The feature provides an alternative solution to the
          Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), allowing users to turn
          off STP and still provide basic link redundancy.
          
          Flex Links are typically configured in service provider
          or enterprise networks where users do not want to run
          STP on the device.

          The MIB module provides a means to monitor and configure
          the Cisco IOS proprietary Hot Standby Router Protocol
          (HSRP). Cisco HSRP protocol is defined in RFC2281.
          
          Terminology:
          
          HSRP is a protocol used amoung a group of routers for the
          purpose of selecting an 'active router' and a 'standby
          router'.
          
          An 'active router' is the router of choice for routing
          packets.
          
          A 'standby router' is a router that takes over the routing
          duties when an active router fails, or when preset
          conditions have been met.
          
          An 'HSRP group' or a 'standby group' is a set of routers
          which communicate using HSRP. An HSRP group has a group MAC
          address and a group Virtual IP address. These are the
          designated addresses. The active router assumes (i.e.
          inherits) these group addresses.
          
          'Hello' messages are sent to indicate that a router is
          running and is capable of becoming the active or standby
          router.
          
          'Hellotime' is the interval between successive HSRP Hello
          messages from a given router.
          
          'Holdtime' is the interval between the receipt of a Hello
          message and the presumption that the sending router has
          failed.

            creation and deletion.
            
            Setting cHsrpGrpRowStatus to 'active' causes the router to
            communicate using HSRP.
            
            The value of cHsrpGrpRowStatus may be set to 'destroy' at
            any time.
            
            Entries may not be created via SNMP without explicitly
            setting cHsrpGrpRowStatus to either 'createAndGo' or
            'createAndWait'.
            
            Entries can be created and modified via the management
            protocol or by the device's local management interface.
            
            A management application wishing to create an entry should
            choose the ifIndex of the interface which is to be added
            as part of an HSRP group. Also, a cHsrpGrpNumber should
            be chosen. A group number is unique only amongst the groups
            on a particular interface. The value of the group number
            appears in packets which are transmitted and received on a
            LAN segment to which the router is connected. The application
            must select the group number as explained in the description
            for cHsrpGrpNumber.
            
            If the row is not active, and a local management interface
            command modifies that row, the row may transition to active
            state.
            
            A row which is not in active state will timeout after a
            configurable period (five minutes by default). This timeout
            period can be changed by setting cHsrpConfigTimeout.

            This object along with the ifIndex of a particular interface
            uniquely identifies an HSRP group.
            
            Group numbers 0,1 and 2 are the only valid group numbers
            for TokenRing interfaces. For other media types, numbers
            range from 0 to 255. Each interface has its own set of group
            numbers. There's no relationship between the groups
            configured on different interfaces. Using a group number
            on one interface doesn't preclude using the same group
            number on a different interface. For example, there can be
            a group 1 on an Ethernet and a group 1 on Token Ring. More
            details can be found from RFC 2281.

            This delay is the time difference between a router power
            up and the time it can actually start preempting the
            currently active router.
            
            When a router first comes up, it doesn't have a complete
            routing table. If it's configured to preempt, then it will
            become the Active router, but it will not be able to
            provide adequate routing services. The solution to this is
            to allow for a configurable delay before the router
            actually preempts the currently active router.

          description: |+
            The cHsrpGrpPriority helps to select the active and the
            standby routers. The router with the highest priority is
            selected as the active router. In the priority range of 0
            to 255, 0 is the lowest priority and 255 is the highest
            priority.
            
            If two (or more) routers in a group have the same priority,
            the one with the highest ip address of the interface is the
            active router. When the active router fails to send a Hello
            message within a configurable period of time, the standby
            router with the highest priority becomes the active
            router.
            
            A router with highest priority will only attempt to
            overthrow a lower priority active router if it is
            configured to preempt.  But, if there is more than one
            router which is not active, the highest priority non-active
            router becomes the standby router.

            Mac Addresses used are as specified in RFC 2281. For

            range 00:00:0c:07:ac:00 through 00:00:0c:07:ac:ff. The last
            octet is the hexadecimal equivalent of cHsrpGrpNumber
            (0-255).
            
            Some Ethernet and FDDI interfaces allow a unicast MAC
            address for each HSRP group. Certain Ethernet

                      multiple logical switches.
          
          Interface Sharing - An interface can be shared among
                  multiple virtual switches.
          
          Speed Group - An interface is capable of operating in any one of
          the speed range depending on the capability of the hardware.
          
          Virtual Link (VL) - Virtual Link is a logical connectivity
              between two end points. A physical interface can
              have multiple Virtual Links.
          
          No Drop Virtual Link - According to 802.3 standard,
              No drop specifies lossless service on a virtual link.
          
          Drop Virtual Link - According to 802.3 standard,
              Traffic drop may occur on this virtual Link.

            For example, if a T1 line is unplugged,
            then framer will detect the loss of signal
            (LOS) on the line  and will count it as a
            transition.

            The ContextName denotes the interface
            'context' and is used to logically separate
            the MIB management.
            RFC 2571 and RFC 2737 describe this approach.
            When the agent supports a different SNMP
            context, as detailed in RFC 2571 and
            RFC 2737, for different interfaces, then the
            value of this object specifies the context
            name used for this interface.

            The Dot1qEtherType allow administrator
            to select a non-standard (other than 0x8100)
            2-byte ethertype for the interface to
            interoperate with third party vendor's system
            that do not use the standard 0x8100 ethertype
            to identify 802.1q-tagged frames.
            
            The current administrative value of the
            802.1q ethertype for the interface.  The
            administrative 802.1q ethertype value may
            differ from the operational 802.1q ethertype
            value.  On some platforms, 802.1q ethertype
            may be assigned per group rather than per port.
            If multiple ports belong to a port group,
            the 802.1q ethertype assigned to any of
            the ports in such group will apply to all
            ports in the same group.
            
            To configure non-standard dot1q ethertype
            is only recommended when the Cisco device
            is connected to any third party vendor device.
            Also be advised that the custom ethertype value
            needs to be changed in the whole cloud of
            Cisco device with the same custom ethertype
            value if the third party device are separated
            by number of Cisco device in the middle.

            This object specifies whether ifIndex values persist across
            reinitialization of the device.
            
            ifIndex persistence means that the mapping between the ifDescr
            object values and the ifIndex object values will be retained
            across reboots.
            
            Applications such as device inventory, billing, and fault
            detection depend on the maintenance of the correspondence
            between particular ifIndex values and their interfaces. During
            reboot or insertion of a new card, the data to correlate the
            interfaces to the ifIndex may become invalid in absence of
            ifIndex persistence feature.
            
            ifIndex persistence for an interface ensures ifIndex value for
            the interface will remain the same after a system reboot. Hence,
            this feature allows users to avoid the workarounds required for
            consistent interface identification across reinitialization.
            
            The allowed values for this object are either enable or disable.
            global value is not allowed.

            no error had been detected to prevent them
            being transmitted.
            
            The packet could be dropped for many reasons,
            which could range from the interface being
            down to errors in the format of the packet.
            
            Discontinuities in the value of this variable
            can occur at re-initialization of the
            management system, and at other times as
            indicated by the values of
            cieIfPacketDiscontinuityTime.

            This data type is used to model an administratively assigned
            name of the current owner of the interface resource. This
            information is taken from the NVT ASCII character set.  It is
            suggested that this name contain one or more of the following:
            SnmpEngineID, IP address, management station name, network
            manager's name, location, or phone number.
            SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the
            contents of MIB views; access to a particular SNMP object
            instance depends only upon its presence or absence in a
            particular MIB view and never upon its value or the value of
            related object instances.
            Thus, this object affords resolution of resource contention
            only among cooperating managers; this object realizes no access
            control function with respect to uncooperative parties.

          This MIB module is for layer 2 tunneling related configurations
          on a device.
          
          Tunneling allows separate local networks to be considered as
          a single VLAN. These separate networks are connected via an
          ISP, which will tunnel the packets from one network to another,
          making it appear as if the two networks are actually just one.

          The CISCO-MODULE-AUTO-SHUTDOWN-MIB is used to configure
          the module automatic shutdown feature. Modules will be
          reset by the system when they become faulty. The module
          auto shutdown feature will shutdown such faulty modules
          when the resets occur too often. Once the modules are
          shutdown by this feature, they will stay shutdown until
          the administrator manually brings them back up. This will
          prevent the system from constantly resetting the faulty
          modules.
          
          This MIB module also covers the system initiated action
          occuring on a module.

          The extended MIB for managing Server Load Balancing
          Manager(s). This MIB extends the SLB management
          functionality in the CISCO-SLB-MIB. The Cisco Content
          Switching Module (CSM) product is the first SLB
          product to support this MIB.
          
          SLB: Server Load Balancing. Server load balancing
          provides for the balancing of packets and connections
          arriving at the SLB device across a number of other
          devices, such as real servers, firewalls, or caches.
          A system containing an SLB device typically exhibits
          higher performance, scalability, and reliability than
          any of the devices being load balanced.  An SLB device
          determines how to handle incoming frames and
          connections according to the contents of incoming data
          and various configuration options. In determining how
          to handle incoming data, an SLB device may examine the
          data at any OSI layer, including Layer 7.
          
          This MIB includes instrumentation for the manager-side
          implementation of the Dynamic Feedback Protocol (DFP).
          A DFP manager uses the DFP protocol to communicate with
          DFP agents in order to obtain information about the
          current load and available capacity of devices.

          An extension to the CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB for SLB
          health monitoring probes.
          
          SLB: Server Load Balancing. Server load balancing
          provides for the balancing of packets and connections
          arriving at the SLB device across a number of other
          devices, such as real servers, firewalls, or caches.
          A system containing an SLB device typically exhibits
          higher performance, scalability, and reliability than
          any of the devices being load balanced.  An SLB device
          determines how to handle incoming frames and
          connections according to the contents of incoming data
          and various configuration options. In determining how
          to handle incoming data, an SLB device may examine the
          data at any OSI layer, including Layer 7.
          
          This MIB includes information on the health monitoring
          probes that can be used for monitoring the health of
          real servers. Health checking provides the ability of
          the content switch to detect if a server is available
          for load balancing. Health probes used for health
          checking allow testing various application level
          functionality. The active probes are sent at regular
          intervals and the lack of a response can lead to a
          specific server or and entire group of servers being
          declared as not available.
          
           Following probes are based on TCP:
              http, https, smtp, telnet, ftp, tcp,
              script, ldap, tacacs, sip, echo, finger.
           Following probes are based on UDP:
              tftp, udp, sip, echo,.

            Real Server    : Real Servers are physical devices
                             assigned to a server farm.
                             Real  servers provide services that

            Health Probe   : The mechanisms to monitor the health
                             of real servers or rservers.
                    Virtual IP          : The IP through which the real server is
                                                       reached during load balancing.
            Probe Instance : An instance of the probe identified by
                                               cslbxProbeName. A probe instance is created
                                               for every probe association.
                                               For example: When a probe is associated with
                                               a real server a probe instance is created
                                               for that probe.
            Probe Port     : This mechanism introduces the capability
                    Inheritance      for the probe instance to inherit the
                                               virtual ip address port or the
                                               the real server port (identified by
                                               cshMonServerfarmRealServerPort) when the
                                               probe port (identified by cslbxProbePort)
                                               is not configured.
                                               The precedence of inheritance is as follows
                                               1. Probe's configured port
                                               2. Real server port
                                               3. Virtual ip address port
                                               4. Probes default port identified by
                                               cslbxProbePort.
                                               Examples:
                                               Scenario 1:
                                               Probe's configured port = 100
                                               Real server port = 200
                                               Virtual ip address port = 300
                                               Probe's default port = 80
                                               Inherited port of the probe instance = 100
                                               Scenario 2:
                                               Probe's configured port = not configured
                                               Real server port = 200
                                               Virtual ip address port = 300
                                               Probe's default port = 80
                                               Inherited port of the probe instance = 200
                                               Scenario 3:
                                               Probe's configured port = not configured
                                               Real server port = not configured
                                               Virtual ip address port = 300
                                               Probe's default port = 80
                                               Inherited port of the probe instance = 300
                                               Scenario 4:
                                               Probe's configured port = not configured
                                               Real server port = not configured
                                               Virtual ip address port = not configured
                                               Probe's default port = 80
                                               Inherited port of the probe instance = 80
                                               Scenario 5:
                                               There can be scenarios wherein there may
                                               be multiple inherited ports for a probe
                                               instance.
                                               There are configurations where multiple virtual
                                               ip addresses with different ports share the
                                               same probe instance and the probe has no
                                               configured port or real server port attached.
                                               In that case the shared probe instance has
                                               multiple inherited ports. A typical scenario
                                               might be
                                               Probe's configured port = not configured
                                               Real server port = not configured
                                               Ports of the virtual ip addresses which
                                               shares the probe instance = 300,400

            HTTP(for both  1.0 and 1.1) probes.
            
            The pure HTTP/1.0 requires that a seperate
            TCP connection to be opened for each downloaded
            object.  The persistence allows TCP connections
            to be re-used while requesting multiple objects
            without incurring a overhead of opening a new
            TCP connection.

            This object enables/disables reusing of the SSL

            every time the client and the SSL module go through a
            full key exchange and establish a new master secret key.
            Enabling this object allows the SSL module to reuse the
            master key on subsequent connections with the client,
            which can speed up the SSL negotiation process.

            The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an ASCII-based,
            application-layer control protocol that can be used to
            establish, maintain, and terminate calls between two
            or more endpoints. SIP is an alternative protocol
            developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
            for multimedia conferencing over IP.
            
            This table supports configuration of the probe
            attributes in addition to the attributes configured

          This MIB includes instrumentation for the manager-side
          implementation of the Dynamic Feedback Protocol (DFP).
          A DFP uses the DFP protocol to communicate with
          DFP agents in order to obtain information about
          Servers.
          
          This MIB includes the objects required for implementing
          the load balancer management side of the
          Server/Application State Protocol (SASP).  The load
          balancer is responsible for registering Members with a
          SASP-Agent.  A Member is an entity that is defined on
          the load balancer to service Internet traffic.  The
          responsibility of the Agent is to monitor the Members,
          and report a recommended weight to the load balancer.
          The weight is then used in load balancing decisions.

            The SASP weight converted to the local load balancer
            weight range.  The load balancer's weight range is
            implementation dependent, as is the formula used to
            convert the weight.
            
            The following formula is an example weight conversion
            that could be used by the load balancer:
            
            answer => slbSaspMemberConvertedWeight
            maxLbWgt => slbSaspMaxLbWeight
            mbrSaspWgt => slbSaspMemberSaspWeight
            
            answer = ((mbrSaspWgt * maxLbWgt) / 65535) + 1
            
            Note: There are two edge cases that need to be
            considered; when the mbrSaspWgt is 0 and 65535.  If the
            mbrSaspWgt is 0, then the converted weight must also be
            0 (the result of the calculation would be 1).  If the
            mbrSaspWgt is 65535, then the converted weight must be
            the load balancers maximum weight (the result of the
            calculation would be the load balancers maxiumum weight
            plus 1).

            For devices that allows dynamic determination of whether
            a link between two switches should be a trunk or not, this
            object allows the operator to mandate the behavior of that
            dynamic mechanism.
            
            on(1) dictates that the interface will always be a
            trunk. This is the value for static entries (those that
            show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported
            on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end
            to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.
            
            off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified
            interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic
            mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for
            overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the
            negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take
            place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the
            far end into non-trunking state.
            
            desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for
            the interface to become a trunk.  The device will initiate
            any negotiation necessary to become a trunk but will not
            become a trunk unless it receives confirmation from the far
            end on the link.
            
            auto(4) is used to indicate that the interface is capable
            and willing to become a trunk but will not initiate
            trunking negotiations.  The far end on the link are
            required to either start negotiations or start sending
            encapsulated packets, on which event the specified
            interface will become a trunk.
            
            onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is
            permanently set to be a trunk, and no negotiation takes
            place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent
            operation. This is similar to on(1) except no negotiation
            takes place with the far end.
            
            If the port does not support negotiation or its
            vlanTrunkPortEncapsulationType is set to negotiate(5),
            onNoNegotiate(5) is not allowed.
            
            Devices that do no support dynamic determination (for just
            a particular interface, encapsulation or for the whole
            device) need only support the 'on', and 'off' values.

            the secret key is configured by the user, it is
            stored as a hexadecimal string in the device's
            configuration and the password is considered to be
            the secret key's matching password and hidden
            from the configuration automatically.
            
            This object is not allowed to be set at the same
            time when vtpAuthPassword is set.
            
            The secret key is overwritten by a newly generated
            secret key when the password is re-configured.

            The table contains the authentication information of VTP
            in which the local system participates.
            
            The security mechanism of VTP relies on a secret key
            that is used to alter the MD5 digest of the packets
            transmitted on the wire.  The secret value is
            created from a password that may be saved in plain text
            in the configuration or hidden from the configuration.
            
            The device creating or modifying the VTP configuration
            signs it using the MD5 digest generated from the secret
            key before advertising it. Other devices in the domain
            receive this configuration use the same secret key
            to accept it if correctly signed or drop it otherwise.
            
            The user has the option to hide the password from the
            configuration. Once the password is hidden, the secret
            key generated from the password is shown in the
            configuration instead, and there is no other way to
            show the password in plain text again but clearing
            it or resetting it.
            
            In an un-trusted area, the password on a device can
            be configured without being unveiled. After that,
            it has to be provided again by setting the same
            value to vtpDatabaseTakeOverPassword if the user
            wants to take over the whole VTP management domain
            of the database type.
            
            When managementDomainVersionInUse is version3(4), the
            authentication mechanism is common to all VTP
            database type.

            The Configuration Revision Number to be used for the next
            apply operation.  This value is initialized (by the agent)
            on a copy operation to be one greater than the value of
            managementDomainConfigRevNumber. On an apply, if the
            number is less or equal to the value of
            managementDomainConfigRevNumber, then the apply fails.
            The value can be modified (increased) by network management
            before an apply to ensure that an apply does not fail for
            this reason.
            
            This object is used to allow management control over whether
            a configuration revision received via a VTP advertisement
            after a copy operation but before the succeeding apply
            operation is lost by being overwritten by the (local) edit
            operation.  By default, the apply operation will fail in
            this situation.  By increasing this object's value after the
            copy but before the apply, management can control whether
            the apply is to succeed (with the update via VTP
            advertisement being lost).

            This object always has the value 'none' when read.  When
            written, each value causes the appropriate action:
            
             'copy' - causes the creation of rows in the
            vtpVlanEditTable exactly corresponding to the current global
            VLAN information for this management domain.  If the Edit
            Buffer (for this management domain) is not currently empty,
            a copy operation fails.  A successful copy operation starts
            the deadman-timer.
            
             'apply' - first performs a consistent check on the the
            modified information contained in the Edit Buffer, and if
            consistent, then tries to instanciate the modified
            information as the new global VLAN information.  Note that
            an empty Edit Buffer (for the management domain) would
            always result in an inconsistency since the default VLANs
            are required to be present.
            
             'release' - flushes the Edit Buffer (for this management
            domain), clears the Owner information, and aborts the
            deadman-timer.  A release is generated automatically if the
            deadman-timer ever expires.
            
             'restartTimer' - restarts the deadman-timer.
            
             'none' - no operation is performed.

            initialized, by a 'copy' operation, to be the current global
            VLAN information for that management domain.  After
            initialization, editing can be performed to add VLANs,
            delete VLANs, or modify their global parameters.  The
            information as modified through editing is local to this
            Edit Buffer.  An apply operation using the
            vtpVlanEditOperation object is necessary to instanciate the
            modified information as the new global VLAN information for
            that management domain.
            
            To use the Edit Buffer, a manager acts as follows:
            
            1. ensures the Edit Buffer for a management domain is empty,
            i.e., there are no rows in this table for this management
            domain.
            
            2. issues a SNMP set operation which sets
            vtpVlanEditOperation to 'copy', and vtpVlanEditBufferOwner
            to its own identifier (e.g., its own IP address).
            
            3. if this set operation is successful, proceeds to edit the
            information in the vtpVlanEditTable.
            
            4. if and when the edited information is to be instantiated,
            issues a SNMP set operation which sets vtpVlanEditOperation
            to 'apply'.
            
            5. issues retrieval requests to obtain the value of
            vtpVlanApplyStatus, until the result of the apply is
            determined.
            
            6. releases the Edit Buffer by issuing a SNMP set operation
            which sets vtpVlanEditOperation to 'release'.
            
            Note that the information contained in this table is not
            saved across agent reboots.

            zones are filled. As a result of this,
            the ids of the corresponding zones are

          description: |+
            The zoneSetZoneList object and the
            zoneSetZoneListTable allow upto 8192
            zones to be associated with a zoneset.
            This is done with the help of 4 bitmaps
            each of which represent 2048 zones. There
            may exist a situation where the 'lowest'
            bitmap may not be fully populated but
            'higher' bitmaps may have bits set in them.
            Semantically what this means is: the lowest
            2048 zones have not been fully associated,
            but zones with higher ids have been
            associated. This kind of a situation causes
            problems for management stations which are
            only aware of older versions of this MIB. They
            are only aware of zoneSetZoneList object and
            hence only the 'lowest' 2048 zones that are
            associated with a zoneset. In the above
            situation, the total number of zones
            associated with the zoneset could be less
            than 2048. But by virtue of being distributed
            in the 'higher' bitmaps, those zones will
            not be seen by those management stations as
            they are not aware of the new objects in
            zoneSetZoneListTable. In such a situation,
            a management station which is aware of this
            version of the MIB, can choose to compact
            the zones associated with zonesets on a
            VSAN, so that the holes in the lowest 2048
            zones are filled.
            
            Note that this table facilitates compaction
            of only the first 2048 zones and not zones
            belonging to 'higher' bitmaps.

            The procedure for modifying these objects is
            as follows:
            
            1. Determine new values for
               zoneCopyActToFullMode, zoneCopyActToFullOnVsan.
            
            2. Retrieve the value of zoneCopyActToFullSpinLock.
            
            3. Set the value of zoneCopyActToFullSpinLock to
               the retrieved value, and (in the same PDU) the value
               of zoneCopyActToFullMode to the new
               value. If the set fails for zoneCopyActToFullSpinLock,
               go back to step 2.
            
            4. Set the value of zoneCopyActToFullSpinLock to
               the retrieved value plus one, and (in the same PDU)
               the value of zoneCopyActToFullOnVsan to the new
               value. If the set fails for
               zoneCopyActToFullSpinLock object, go back to step
               2.
            
               Note that if it's possible to include
               zoneCopyActToFullOnVsan in the (Set Req)
               PDU of the earlier step, then step 4 can be
               eliminated.

            of zoneMergeFailRecoverInterface,
            zoneMergeFailRecoverVsan and
            zoneMergeFailRecoverOper by multiple managers.
            The procedure for modifying these objects is
            as follows:
            
            1. Determine new values for
               zoneMergeFailRecoverInterface, zoneMergeFail-
               RecoverVsan and zoneMergeFailRecoverOper.
            
            2. Retrieve the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock.
            
            3. Set the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock to
               the retrieved value, and (in the same PDU) the value
               of zoneMergeFailRecoverInterface to the new
               value. If the set fails for
               zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock object, go back to step
               2.
            
            4. Set the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock to
               the retrieved value plus one, and (in the same PDU)
               the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverVsan to the new
               value. If the set fails for
               zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock object, go back to step
               2.
            
            5. Set the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock to
               the retrieved value plus two, and (in the same PDU)
               the value of zoneMergeFailRecoverOper to the new
               value. If the set fails for
               zoneMergeFailRecoverSpinLock object, go back to step
               2.
            
               Note that if it's possible to include
               zoneMergeFailRecoverVsan and/or
               zoneMergeFailRecoverOper in the (Set Req) PDU
               of an earlier step, then steps 4 and/or 5 can
               be eliminated.

            The value of this object identifies the logical entity
            that defines the naming scope for the associated instance
            of the 'entAliasMappingIdentifier' object.
            
            If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the
            logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex.
            
            If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between
            the physical component and the alias identifier for this
            entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified
            logical entities.  That is, a value of zero (the default
            mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have
            an explicit entry in this table for a particular
            entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair.
            
            For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g.,
            physical component 33) is identified by the same value of
            ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance
            might exist:
            
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5
            
            In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently
            for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping
            entries may exist, e.g.:
            
            
            
            
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 =  ifIndex.1
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 =  ifIndex.1
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12
            
            Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero
            index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries.  In
            this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10,
            associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.

            The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual
            row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and
            entLogicalIndex pair.
            
            Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only
            entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed.  If
            an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port,
            then this object should identify the associated 'ifEntry'.
            For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the
            'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead.
            
            For example, suppose a physical port was represented by
            entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a
            repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge.  Then
            there might be two related instances of
            entAliasMappingIdentifier:
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17
            It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and
            repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required.
            
            Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and
            appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort',
            and are thus not represented in this table.
        entAliasMappingTable:

            This table contains zero or more rows, representing
            mappings of logical entity and physical component to
            external MIB identifiers.  Each physical port in the system
            may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier,
            which itself is associated with a particular logical
            entity's naming scope.  A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided
            to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than
            one logical entity.
        entLPMappingEntry: 
          name: entLPMappingEntry

            Information about a particular logical entity to physical
            equipment association.  Note that the nature of the
            association is not specifically identified in this entry.
            It is expected that sufficient information exists in the
            MIBs used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how
            physical component information is utilized.
        entLPMappingTable: 
          name: entLPMappingTable
          oid: 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1
          nodetype: table
          status: current
          description: |+
            This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to
            physical equipment associations.  For each logical entity
            known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the
            physical resources, which are used to realize that logical
            entity.
            
            An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
            this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant
            information is returned.  For example, in a system that
            contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
            entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
            be included.
            
            Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is
            closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should
            be identified in an entLPMapping entry.
            
            For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
            module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
            bridge.  A mapping between the bridge and the module would
            be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and
            each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because
            the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same
            information).  On the other hand, if more than one bridge
            were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between
            each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.
            
            Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping
            for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not
            necessary.

            An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2C community-string, which can be used to
            access detailed management information for this logical
            entity.  The agent should allow read access with this
            community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed
            objects) and may also return a community string based on the
            privileges of the request used to read this object.  Note
            that an agent may return a community string with read-only
            privileges, even if this object is accessed with a
            read-write community string.  However, the agent must take
            
            
            
            care not to return a community string that allows more
            privileges than the community string used to access this
            object.
            
            A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by
            representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default'
            naming scope.  This is possible when the logical entities,
            represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have
            no object instances in common.  For example, 'bridge1' and
            'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at
            least one additional community string is needed to represent
            'bridge2' and 'repeater2'.
            
            Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be
            represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default'
            naming scope.
            
            For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2C, the value

            been assigned by the agent, or if no community string with
            suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP
            request.
            
            Note that this object is deprecated.  Agents which implement
            SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and
            entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context

            Not every physical component will have an asset tracking
            identifier, or even need one.  Physical entities for which

            to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater
            module), do not need their own unique asset tracking
            identifier.  An agent does not have to provide write access
            for such entities, and may instead return a zero-length
            string.
            
            If write access is implemented for an instance of

          description: |+
            An indication of the relative position of this 'child'
            component among all its 'sibling' components.  Sibling
            components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the
            same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn
            and entPhysicalClass objects.
            
            An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering
            for all sibling components of a particular parent
            (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each
            sibling entry).
            
            If possible, this value should match any external labeling
            of the physical component.  For example, for a container
            (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3',
            entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'.  Note
            that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3
            should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.
            
            If the physical position of this component does not match
            any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then
            user documentation or other external reference material
            should be used to determine the parent-relative position.
            If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a
            consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set
            of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal
            representation of the components.
            
            
            
            
            If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
            for some reason, or if the associated value of
            entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is
            returned.  Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned,
            indicating the parent-relative position of this physical
            entity.
            
            Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and
            continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest
            positioned child entity.  However, if the physical entities
            (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero,
            then the first sibling should be associated with an
            entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'.  Note that this
            ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent
            implementation.
            
            The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as
            each 'parent' component may use different numbering
            algorithms.  The ordering is only meaningful among siblings
            of the same parent component.
            
            The agent should retain parent-relative position values
            across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use
            of non-volatile storage.

            entity.  The preferred value is the serial number string
            actually printed on the component itself (if present).
            
            On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value
            of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set
            to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this
            information is available to the agent.  If a serial number
            is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be
            set to a zero-length string instead.
            
            Note that implementations that can correctly identify the
            serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not
            need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum
            object.  Agents which cannot provide non-volatile storage
            for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to
            implement write access for this object.
            
            Not every physical component will have a serial number, or
            even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated
            value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)'
            (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not
            need their own unique serial number.  An agent does not have
            to provide write access for such entities, and may return a
            zero-length string.
            
            If write access is implemented for an instance of
            entPhysicalSerialNum, and a value is written into the
            instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the
            entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same
            physical entity) for as long as that entity remains
            instantiated.  This includes instantiations across all
            re-initializations/reboots of the network management system,
            including those resulting in a change of the physical

            The value during the current sampling period is not made
            available until the period is completed.
            
            To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the

            and the value of this object adjusted as necessary.
            
            If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the
            sampling interval, then this object will have a value of
            zero and the associated instance of hcAlarmValueStatus will

            The lower 32 bits of the absolute value for threshold for
            the sampled statistic.  The actual threshold value is
            determined by the associated instances of the
            hcAlarmRisingThreshAbsValueHi and
            hcAlarmRisingThresholdValStatus objects, as follows:
            
               ABS(threshold) = hcAlarmRisingThreshAbsValueLo +
                     (hcAlarmRisingThreshAbsValueHi * 2^^32)
            
            The absolute value of the threshold is adjusted as required,
            as described in the HcValueStatus textual convention.  These
            three object instances are conceptually combined to
            represent the rising threshold for this entry.
            
            When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to
            this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval
            was less than this threshold, a single event will be
            generated.  A single event will also be generated if the
            first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than
            or equal to this threshold and the associated
            hcAlarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or
            risingOrFallingAlarm(3).
            
            After a rising event is generated, another such event will
            not be generated until the sampled value falls below this
            threshold and reaches the threshold identified by the
            hcAlarmFallingThreshAbsValueLo,

            The desired state of the interface.  The testing(3) state
            indicates that no operational packets can be passed.  When a
            managed system initializes, all interfaces start with
            ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state.  As a result of either
            explicit management action or per configuration information
            retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then

            This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as
            specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile
            'handle' for the interface.
            
            On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of
            ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length
            string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of
            ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the
            agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
            associated with the same interface for as long as that
            interface remains instantiated, including across all re-
            initializations/reboots of the network management system,
            including those which result in a change of the interface's
            ifIndex value.
            
            An example of the value which a network manager might store
            in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit
            number/identifier of the interface.
            
            Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces
            having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports
            write access to this object is required to keep the value in
            non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
            values depending on how much storage is already occupied by
            the current values for other interfaces.

            are only required for those addresses for which the system
            would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous

            bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for
            which the interface will accept frames.

            For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active

            This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.
            
            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:
            
            try_again:
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)

              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult
            
              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'
            
              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId
            
              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid
            
            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.
            
            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first
            
            
            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
            the results are for the desired request.
            
            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
            period be 5 minutes.
            
            In general, a management station must not retransmit a
            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
            retransmitted.
            
            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
            reboot after completion of the test.  In these
            circumstances, communication with the management station
            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
            make every effort to transmit a response to the request
            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
            the minimum amount of information after that test
            completes.

            discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement
            of address mappings into the central addressMapTable.
            
            Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored
            interface upon initialization so that a default collection

            If this object is set to a value less than the current number

            This object may be used to control how resources are allocated

            If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this
            object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex
            object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface.
            For example, if an entry were to receive data from
            interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.
            
            If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this

            may only point to index objects, this object may at times
            point to repeater port objects.  This situation occurs when
            the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally
            attached repeater and the agent has additional information
            about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.

            When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object
            is created or modified, the probe should set this
            object as closely to the requested value as
            possible for the particular implementation and
            available resources. The probe must not lower this
            value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated
            alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object.
            
            If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to
            alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the
            next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest
            value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in
            decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or
            until there are no more matrix entries.
            
            If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to
            alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the

            or until there are no more matrix entries.
            
            It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the

            MAC errors.
            
            Further, this table will only contain entries that have a

            part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set
            this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility

            If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe

            Note that some combinations of index values may result in an
            index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds

            This object describes and configures the probe's support for
            the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this
            protocol.  When the probe creates entries in this table for
            all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to
            notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the
            nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is
            implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this
            protocol.  Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the
            probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both
            the nlHostTable and the alHostTable.
            
            If the associated protocolDirType object has the
            addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network-
            layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and
            
            
            
            thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable
            with addresses it discovers for this protocol.
            
            If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
            will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this
            protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any
            other value.  If the value of this object is supportedOn(3),
            the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable
            for this protocol and is configured to track both tables
            for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces.
            If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe
            supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this
            protocol but is configured to not track these tables
            for any control entries or interfaces.
            Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to
            supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in
            the nlHostTable and alHostTable.
            
            Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol
            directory entries, one for the network address and one for the
            type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will
            only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3)
            for both protocols.

            can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e.,
            a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the
            protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic
            assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees.  See RFC 2074 for
            more details.
            
            Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place
            entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect.  In
            other words, it need not populate this table with all
            possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on
            the fly when it sees them.  Whether it does these
            things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit,
            usability) and is up to the designer of the product.
            
            If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that
            the agent doesn't understand, either directly or
            algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an
            inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.

            This object describes and configures the probe's support for
            the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this
            protocol.  When the probe creates entries in this table for
            all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to
            notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the
            nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are
            implemented but don't have the capability to track this
            protocol.  Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented,
            the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in
            both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the
            alMatrixTables.
            
            If the associated protocolDirType object has the
            addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network-
            
            
            
            layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and
            thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and
            both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for
            this protocol.
            
            If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
            will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the
            alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this
            object to be changed to any other value.  If the value of this
            object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both
            of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the
            alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track
            these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all
            interfaces.  If the value of this object is supportedOff(2),
            the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and
            (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol
            but is configured to not track these tables for this
            protocol for any control entries or interfaces.
            Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to
            supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in
            the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables.
            
            Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol
            directory entries, one for the network address and one for the
            type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will
            only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3)
            for both protocols.

            protocols.  The agent should boot up with this table
            preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and
            wishes to monitor.  Implementations are strongly encouraged to
            support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for
            the protocol distribution group), even for implementations
            that don't support the application-layer groups.

          description: |+
            This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol
            directory entry.
            
            The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes
            whether this protocol directory entry can be extended
            by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are
            children of this protocol.
            
            An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
            
            
            
            'ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
            of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'.
            A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
            children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
            table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
            probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for
            which the probe does have built-in support),
            that child node is not extendable.  This is termed 'limited
            extensibility'.
            
            When a child node is added through this extensibility
            mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
            protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.
            
            The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
            manager who is creating the new entry.
            
            This object also describes whether this agent can
            recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a
            network-level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able
            to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol
            and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to
            recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate
            network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses
            in this protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will
            recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and
            populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix
            tables with these protocols.
            
            Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
            values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
            with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
            usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
            bits will usually be set to zero.

            Rationale:
            This table controls collection of very basic statistics
            for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface.
            An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth
            allocation utilized by different protocols.
            
            A media-specific statistics collection could also
            be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain
            total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same
            interface.

            Note that it is strongly recommended that this object
            be stored in non-volatile memory so that it remains

            Also, implementations which authenticate community-based
            SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching
            the community name (for example, by also checking
            whether the message originated from a transport address
            allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include
            in this value the number of messages which failed the
            additional check(s).  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that
            the documentation for any security model which is used
            to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify
            the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

            the SNMP community named in the message.  The precise
            conditions under which this counter is incremented
            (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements
            its access control mechanism and how its applications
            interact with that access control mechanism.  It is
            strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any
            access control mechanism which is used to control access
            to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the
            precise conditions that contribute to this value.

            A value which indicates the set of services that this
            entity may potentially offer.  The value is a sum.
            This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for
            each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node
            performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added
            to the sum.  For example, a node which performs only
            routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).
            In contrast, a node which is a host offering application
            services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).
            Note that in the context of the Internet suite of
            protocols, values should be calculated accordingly:
            
                 layer      functionality
                   1        physical (e.g., repeaters)

                   7        applications (e.g., supports the SMTP)
            
            For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6
            may also be counted.

            LdomVmemPhysBind Table:
            This table contains physical memory segments assigned to all
            LDOMs. Each row will contain a list of physical-address,
            real-address and size which is mapped to each virtual memory
            block. Memory space seen in an LDOM is referred to as the real
            memory, i.e. virtual memory. Host platform memory space
            seen by the hypervisor is referred to as physical memory.
            The hypervisor maps blocks of physical memory to form
            a block of real memory which is used by an LDOM.
            For example an LDOM which asks for 521 megabytes (real
            memory) can be assigned by two blocks of 256 megabytes
            in host system (physical memory), then there will be
            two rows for these memory segments as follows (in format
            {physical-address, real-address, size}):
            {0x1000000, 0x1000000, 256}
            {0x2000000,0x2000000,256}
            
            The LDOM can conceivably have up to 64 physical memory
            segments assigned to a guest.

            Virtual Network Switch Service Table:
            In LDOM virtual network support enable guest domains to
            communicate with each other, and with external hosts via
            a physical ethernet device. Two main components make up the
            virtual network; the virtual switch (vsw) and virtual
            network device (vnet). This table contains virtual switch
            services for all LDOMs. Sysadmin creates a virtual switch
            on a service LDOM and  a physical network device can be
            bound to the virtual switch. From then on a client LDOM
            can create virtual network device which uses the virtual
            switch service to communicate with other LDOMs (connecting
            to the same virtual switch), and to the outside world
            (if a physical device is bound to the virtual switch).

              The temperature sensor detects a condition that could
              possibly damage the system.
            
            The system will automatically shutdown if the failed(4) condition
            results, so it is unlikely that this value will ever be returned
            by the agent.

            The frequency, in seconds, at which the Agent requests
            information from.  A frequency of zero indicates that the
            Agent retrieves the information upon request of a
            management station, it does not poll at a specific interval.

            object will fail.  If the poll frequency is non-zero,

            the poll frequency to a value that would severely impact system

            RAID Level.
            
            This shows the RAID level of the RAIDset.
            To change the RAID level, run the CL1850 Array
            Configuration Utility.
            
            The following values are valid for the RAIDset RAID
            Level:
            
            JBOD (2)
               Just a Bunch of Drives. Fault tolerance is not enabled. This
               RAIDset is made up of one device. Does not provide extended data
               redundancy, availability or protection, and does not use striping
               for performance enhancements.
               Good for applications requiring high device capacity. Requires one
               and only one device.
            
            RAID0 (3)
               A RAIDset using device striping and write-back caching.
               Data is spread across many devices, offering faster read/write
               performance than a single device. Does not provide extended data
               redundancy, availability or protection. Good for applications with
               large files needing high I/O performance. Requires a minimum of
               two devices.
            
            RAID1 (4)
               A RAIDset using device mirroring. Any time data is written to
               a device, a duplicate write is also made to a second device. Reading
               from multiple devices is usually faster than reading from a single
               device. Provides extended data redundancy, availability and
               protection. Good for read-intensive applications needing high
               availability. Requires a minimum of two devices.
            
            RAID0PLUS1 (5)
               A RAIDset where data is striped across devices and duplicated
               on an equivalent number of devies. Provides extended data
               redundancy, availability and protection. Good for applications
               requiring high availability, high performance and capacity.
               Requires an even number of devices, and a minimum of four devices.
            
            RAID4 (6)
               A RAIDset using device striping, with one device assigned for
               parity. Provides extended data redundancy, availability and
               protection. Good for applications such as graphics and imaging that
               call for writing huge, sequential blocks of data. Requires a minimum
               of three devices.
            
            RAID5(7)
               A RAIDset using device striping, with parity distributed across
               devices. Provides extended data redundancy, availability and
               protection. Good for transaction processing, applications requiring
               many, small I/O operations scattered randomly and widely across the
               devices. Requires a minimum of three devices.

            After a failed physical drive has been replaced, the physical
            drive must have its data rebuilt.  This value shows how far
            the rebuild process has progressed as a percentage.
            When the value reaches 100, the rebuilding process is complete.
            The drive array continues to operate in reduced mode while a
            drive is rebuilding.
            
            This value is only valid if the RAIDset Status is

            is calculated using the value 1,048,576 (2^20) as a megabyte.
            Drive manufacturers sometimes use the number 1,000,000 as a
            megabyte when giving drive capacities so this value may
            differ from the advertised size of a drive.

            Good (2)
              Indicates that the RAIDset is fully operational.
            
            Reduced (3)
              Indicates that the RAIDset is operating in a degraded or
              reduced state. One or more of the physical disks which make
              up the RAIDset are either missing or failed, but the
              RAIDset can continue to operate without data loss.
            
            Failed (4)
              Indicates that the RAIDset is not operational.
            
            Reconstructing (5)
              Indicates that the RAIDset is regenerating a failed
              physical drive's data onto a replacement drive that is part
              of the RAIDset.
            
              All user data remains available during the reconstruction
              process, but some performance reduction may occur when a
              request requires access to the device being reconstructed.
            
            Initializing (6)
              Indicates that the controller is writing its file structure
              onto the RAIDset's member devices.

            This index maps the physical drive back to the controller to
            which it is attached. The value of this index is the same as
            the one used under the controller group.

            This is a text description of the physical drive.  The text that
            appears depends upon who manufactured the drive and the drive
            type.
            
            For example, you might see:  CP3201.
            
            If a drive fails, note the model to identify the type of drive
            necessary for replacement.

            This is the size of the physical drive in megabytes.  This value
            is calculated using the value 1,048,576 (2^20) as a megabyte.
            Drive manufacturers sometimes use the number 1,000,000 as a
            megabyte when giving drive capacities so this value may differ
            from the advertised size of a drive.  This field is only
            applicable for controllers which support SCSI drives, and
            therefore is not supported by the IDA or IDA-2 controllers.
            The field will contain 0xFFFFFFFF if the drive capacity cannot
            be calculated or if the controller does not support SCSI drives.

            None (2)
              Indicates that no data loss occurred.  The battery packs were
              properly charged when the system was initialized.
            
            Possible (3)
              Indicates that at power up, the battery packs were not
              sufficiently charged.  Because the batteries did not retain
              sufficient charge when the system resumed power, the board
              has not retained any data that may have been stored.
              If no data was on the board, no data was lost.  Several things
              may have caused this condition:
            
              * If the system was without power for eight days, and the
                battery packs were on (battery packs only activate if
                system looses power unexpectedly), any data that may have
                been stored in the cache was lost.
            
              * There may be a problem with the battery pack.
                See the Battery Status for more information.
            
              * This status will also appear if the Array Accelerator
                board is replaced with a new board that has discharged
                batteries.  No data has been lost in this case, and posted
                writes will automatically be enabled when the batteries
                reach full charge.

              Indicates that a particular battery pack is fully charged.
            
            Charging (3)
              The battery power is less than 75%.  The array controller
              is attempting to recharge the battery.  A battery can take
              as long as 36 hours to fully recharge.  After 36 hours,
              if the battery has not recharged, it is considered failed.
            
            Failed (4)
              The battery pack is below the sufficient voltage level and
              has not recharged in 36 hours.  Your Array Accelerator board
              needs to be serviced.

              configured and enabled for at least one logical drive.
              No write cache errors have occurred.
            
            Bad Configuration (3)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board was configured for a
              different controller.  This error could be caused if boards
              were switched from one system to another.  Rerun the
              configuration utility and ensurethat the board has been
              properly configured for this system.
            
            Low Battery Power (4)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled due to insufficient battery power.  Please view
              the Battery Status object instance for more information.
            
            Disable Command Issued (5)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The device driver issues this command when
              the server is taken down.  This condition should not
              exist when the system regains power.
            
            No Resources Available (6)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The controller does not have sufficient
              resources to perform write cache operations.
              For example, when a replaced drive is being rebuilt,
              there will not be sufficient resources.  Once the
              operation that requires the resources has completed,
              this condition will clear and write cache operations
              will resume.
            
            Board Not Connected (7)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board has been
              configured but is not currently attached to the
              controller. Check the alignment of the board and
              connections.
            
            Bad Mirror Data (8)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been
              permanently disabled.  The Array Accelerator board stores
              mirrored copies of all data.  If data exists on the
              board when the system is first powered up, the board
              performs a data compare test between the mirrored copies.
              If the data does not match, an error has occurred.
              Data may have been lost.  Your board may need servicing.
            
            Read Failure (9)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The Array Accelerator board stores mirror copies
              of all data.  While reading the data from the board, memory
              parity errors have occurred.  Both copies were corrupted and
              cannot be retrieved.  Data has been lost, and you should
              service the board.
            
            Write Failure (10)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  This error occurs when an unsuccessful attempt was
              made to write data to the Array Accelerator board.  Data could
              not be written to write cache memory in duplicate due to the
              detection of parity errors.  This error does not indicate data
              loss.  You should service the Array Accelerator board.
            
            Config Command (11)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The configuration of the logical drives has changed.
              You need to reconfigure the Array Accelerator board.
            
            Expand In Progress (12)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled
              due to an expand of a logical drive.  When the expand
              operation completes, the accelerator will be enabled.
            
            Snapshot In Progress (13)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled
              due to a snapshot operation that is queued up or in progress.
              When the snapshot operation completes, the accelerator will
              be enabled.
            
            Redundant Low Battery (14)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled.
              The redundant controller has insufficient cache battery power.
            
            Redundant Size Mismatch (15)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled.
              The cache sizes on the redundant controllers do not match.
            
            Redundant Cache Failure (16)
              Indicates that cache operations are temporarily disabled.
              The cache on the redundant controller has failed.
            
            Excessive ECC Errors (17)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  The number of cache lines experiencing excessive
              ECC errors has reached a preset limit.
            
            Power On Self Test (Post) ECC Errors (19)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been permanently

            Array Accelerator Board Read Errors.
            
            This shows the total number of read memory parity errors that
            were detected while reading from the Array Accelerator board.
            The mirrored copy of data on the board can be accessed to
            obtain correct data if a memory parity errors occurs.
            
            Memory parity errors occur when the system detects that
            information has not been transferred correctly.  A parity bit
            is included for each byte of information stored in memory.
            When the microprocessor reads or writes data, the system
            counts the value of the bits in each byte.  If a total does
            not match the system's expectations, a parity error has
            occurred. A bad memory chip, memory corruption, or lack of
            refresh may cause memory parity errors.

            Logical Drive Auto-Reliability Delay.
            
            This value indicates how many seconds the logical drive will wait
            with no requests before beginning Auto-Reliability monitoring.
            For example, the default value is five, so the logical drive will
            begin Auto-Reliability monitoring if it receives no requests for
            five seconds.  If the value is zero, the logical drive will not
            perform Auto-Reliability monitoring.  Auto-Reliability only
            operates if the logical drive is configured in one of the fault
            tolerance modes.
            
            If the logical drive receives a request while performing
            Auto-Reliability monitoring, the drive will stop monitoring to
            process the request.  Once it has satisfied all incoming requests,
            the drive will wait for the Auto-Reliability delay to expire
            before returning to Auto-Reliability monitoring.
            
            Auto-Reliability monitoring is a process to insure the highest
            level of data reliability.  In this process each disk is scanned
            to verify that all of the sectors in the array are readable.
            If the Auto-Reliability monitoring process detects any bad
            sectors on the drives, it automatically remaps these bad sectors
            where possible.
            
            If the value cannot be determined or is not applicable, the
            value is set to -1.

            The logical drive blink time variable allows the drive tray LEDs
            of all physical drives in a logical drive to blink.  This value
            indicates the amount of time, in tenths of a second, that the

            To blink the drive LEDs on all physical drives in this logical
            drive (including any configured spare drives), set this value
            to the time to blink in tenths of seconds.

            Tolerance:
            
            None (2)
              Fault tolerance is not enabled.  If a physical drive reports
              an error, the data cannot be recovered by the array
              controller.
            
            Mirroring (3)
              For each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
              containing identical data. If a drive fails, the data can be
              retrieved from the mirror drive.
            
            Data Guard (4)
              One of the physical drives is used as a data guard drive and
              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the remaining drives.
              If a failure is detected, the External Array Controller
              rebuilds the data using the data guard information plus
              information from the other drives.
            
            Distributed Data Guard (5)
              Distributed Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5,
              is similar to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
              information on one drive, the information is distributed
              across all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the array
              controller rebuilds the data using the data guard information
              from all the drives.
            
            Advanced Data Guarding (7)
              Advanced Data Guarding (RAID ADG) is the fault tolerance method
              that provides the highest level of data protection.  It
              'stripes' data and parity across all the physical drives in the
              configuration to ensure the uninterrupted availability of
              uncorrupted data.  This fault-tolerance method is similar to
              distributed data guard (RAID 5) in that parity data is
              distributed across all drives in the array, except in RAID ADG
              the capacity of multiple drives is used to store parity data.
              Assuming the capacity of 2 drives is used for parity data,
              this allows continued operation despite simultaneous failure of
              any 2 drives in the array, whereas RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only
              sustain failure of a single drive.

            Logical Drive Status.
            
            The logical drive can be in one of the following states:
            
            Ok (2)
              Indicates that the logical drive is in normal operation mode.
            
            Failed (3)
              Indicates that more physical drives have failed than the
              fault tolerance mode of the logical drive can handle without
              data loss.
            
            Unconfigured (4)
              Indicates that the logical drive is not configured.
            
            Recovering (5)
              Indicates that the logical drive is using Interim Recovery Mode.
              In Interim Recovery Mode, at least one physical drive has
              failed, but the logical drive's fault tolerance mode lets the
              drive continue to operate with no data loss.
            
            Ready Rebuild (6)
              Indicates that the logical drive is ready for Automatic Data
              Recovery.  The physical drive that failed has been replaced,
              but the logical drive is still operating in Interim Recovery
              Mode.
            
            Rebuilding (7)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently doing Automatic
              Data Recovery.  During Automatic Data Recovery, fault tolerance
              algorithms restore data to the replacement drive.
            
            Wrong Drive (8)
              Indicates that the wrong physical drive was replaced after a
              physical drive failure.
            
            Bad Connect (9)
              Indicates that a physical drive is not responding.
            
            Overheating (10)
              Indicates that the storage box that contains the logical drive
              is overheating.  The array is still functioning, but
              should be shutdown.
            
            Shutdown (11)
              Indicates that the storage box that contains the logical drive
              has overheated.  The logical drive is no longer functioning.
            
            Expanding (12)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently doing Automatic
              Data Expansion.  During Automatic Data Expansion, fault
              tolerance algorithms redistribute logical drive data to the
              newly added physical drive.
            
            Not Available (13)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently unavailable.
              If a logical drive is expanding and the new configuration
              frees additional disk space, this free space can be
              configured into another logical volume.  If this is done,
              the new volume will be set to not available.
            
            Queued For Expansion (14)
              Indicates that the logical drive is ready for Automatic Data
              Expansion.  The logical drive is in the queue for expansion.
            
            Hard Error (15)
              Indicates that a hard error occurred for this LUN.

            Hard Read Errors.
            
            This shows the number of read errors that have occurred on a
            drive that could not be recovered by a physical drive's Error
            Correction Code (ECC) algorithm or through retries during the
            reference time (phyDrvRefTime).  Over time, a disk drive may
            produce these errors.  If you receive these errors, a problem
            may exist with your drive.
            
            The value increases every time the physical drive detects another
            error.
            
            The severity of these errors depends on whether the monitored
            system is running in a fault tolerant mode. With fault tolerance,
            the controller can remap data to eliminate the problems caused by
            these errors.  In either case, if you see an increase in these
            errors, run diagnostics to verify that a problem exists.
            
            If the value cannot be determined, 4,294,967,295 is
            returned.

            This shows the number of write errors that could not be recovered
            by a physical drive during the reference time (phyDrvRefTime).

            increases every time the physical drive detects another error.
            On average, these errors should occur less frequently than
            read errors.  If you see an increase in these errors, run
            diagnostics to verify that a problem exists.

            The phyDrvHSeekErrs and the phyDrvSeekErrs together shows the
            total number of times that the physical disk drive detected a
            seek error during the reference hours (phyDrvRefHours).
            
            The actual number of seek errors equals the phyDrvHSeekErrs times
            2^32 plus the phyDrvWriteSeekErrs.
            
            Over time, a disk drive usually produces these errors. If you
            notice a rapid increase in the value shown for Seek Errors,
            this physical drive may be failing.
            
            The value increases every time the physical drive produces
            another error.  Only an unusually rapid increase in these errors
            indicates a problem.  If you suspect that a problem exists, run
            diagnostics.
            
            If the value cannot be determined, 4,294,967,295 is

            in the architecture of the MIB.  A change in the major revision
            level may indicate a significant change in the information
            supported and/or the meaning of the supported information.
            Correct interpretation of data may require a MIB document with
            the same major revision level.

            The Minor Revision level of the MIB.
            
            A change in the minor revision level may represent some minor
            additional support, no changes to any pre-existing information
            has occurred.

            The MIB Status Array is an array of MIB status structures. Each
            structure is made up of 4 octets.  The first octet is the MIB
            presence.  The second octet is MIB condition.  The third octet is
            MIB major revision.  The fourth octet is MIB minor revision. These
            blocks of 4 octets each are index by the mib identifier just after
            the compaq enterprise (eg in 1.3.6.1.232.11 mib, the index is 11).
            The 4 octets in the first block (block 0) are reserved for systems
            management and serve as an aggregate of the other mibs.
            
            Array element 0 is the status for all MIBs in the Compaq
            Enterprise.  Array element n, where n > 0, is the status for the
            nth MIB in the Compaq Enterprise (.1.3.6.1.4.1.232.n).

            None (2)
              Indicates that no data loss occurred.  The battery packs were
              properly charged when the system was initialized.
            
            Possible (3)
              Indicates that at power up, the battery packs were not
              sufficiently charged.  Because the batteries did not retain
              sufficient charge when the system resumed power, the board
              has not retained any data that may have been stored.
              If no data was on the board, no data was lost.  Several things
              may have caused this condition:
            
              * If the system was without power for eight days, and the
                battery packs were on (battery packs only activate if
                system looses power unexpectedly), any data that may have
                been stored in the cache was lost.
            
              * There may be a problem with the battery pack.
                See the Battery Status for more information.
            
              * This status will also appear if the Cache Module
                board is replaced with a new board that has discharged
                batteries.  No data has been lost in this case, and posted
                writes will automatically be enabled when the batteries
                reach full charge.

              The backup power source is fully charged.
            
            Recharging (3)
              The array controller has one or more cache module backup power
              sources that are recharging.  Cache module operations such as 
              Battery/Flash Backed Write Cache, Expansion, Extension and Migration
              are temporarily suspended until the backup power source is fully 
              charged.  Cache module operations will automatically resume

            Failed (4)
              The battery pack is below the sufficient voltage level and
              has not recharged in 36 hours.  Your Cache Module board

              The battery is still operating, however, one of the batteries
              in the pack has failed to recharge properly.  Your Cache
              Module board should be serviced as soon as possible.
            
            NotPresent (6)
              A backup power source is not present on the cache module board.
              Some controllers do not have backup power sources.
              
            Capacitor Failed (7)
              The flash backed cache module capacitor is below the sufficient 
              voltage level and has not recharged in 10 minutes.  Your Cache

            Disable Command Issued (5)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The device driver issues this command when
              the server is taken down.  This condition should not
              exist when the system regains power.
            
            No Resources Available (6)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily
              disabled.  The controller does not have sufficient
              resources to perform write cache operations.
              For example, when a replaced drive is being rebuilt,
              there will not be sufficient resources.  Once the
              operation that requires the resources has completed,
              this condition will clear and write cache operations
              will resume.
            
            Board Not Connected (7)
              Indicates that write cache operations are temporarily

              connections.
            
            Bad Mirror Data (8)
              Indicates that write cache operations have been
              permanently disabled.  The Cache Module board stores
              mirrored copies of all data.  If data exists on the
              board when the system is first powered up, the board
              performs a data compare test between the mirrored copies.
              If the data does not match, an error has occurred.
              Data may have been lost.  Your board may need servicing.

            Cache Module Board Read Errors.
            
            This shows the total number of read memory parity errors that
            were detected while reading from the Cache Module board.
            The mirrored copy of data on the board can be accessed to
            obtain correct data if a memory parity errors occurs.
            
            Memory parity errors occur when the system detects that
            information has not been transferred correctly.  A parity bit
            is included for each byte of information stored in memory.
            When the microprocessor reads or writes data, the system
            counts the value of the bits in each byte.  If a total does
            not match the system's expectations, a parity error has
            occurred. A bad memory chip, memory corruption, or lack of
            refresh may cause memory parity errors.

            This describes the status of the cache module and/or cache operations.
            
            Note that for some controller models, a cache module board that 
            physically attaches to the controller or chipset may not be an 
            available option. For these configurations, the Instrument Agent
            will continue to populate variables that are related to read caching
            operations.
            
            The status can be:
            
            Other (1)
              Indicates that the instrument agent does not recognize the
              status of the cache module.  You may need to upgrade
              the instrument agent.
            
            Invalid (2)
              Indicates that a cache module board has not been
              installed in this system or is present but not configured.

              Indicates that cache operations are currently configured
              and enabled for at least one logical drive.
            
            Temporarily Disabled (4)
              Indicates that cache operations have been temporarily
              disabled. View the cache module board error code object
              to determine why the write cache operations have been
              temporarily disabled.
            
            Permanently Disabled (5)
              Indicates that cache operations have been permanently
              disabled.  View the cache module board error code object
              to determine why the write cache operations have been disabled.
              
            Cache Module Flash Memory Not Attached (6)
              Indicates that the flash memory component of the flash backed
              cache module is not attached. This status will be set when the flash 
              memory is not attached and the Supercap is attached. This value is
              only used on flash backed cache modules that support removable flash
              memory.
              
            Cache Module Degraded Failsafe Speed (7)
              Indicates that the cache module board is currently degraded and
              operating at a failsafe speed. View variables 
              cpqDaCacheMemoryDataWidth and cpqDaCacheMemoryTransferRate to
              obtain the cache module board's current memory data width and
              memory transfer rate.
              
            Cache Module Critical Failure (8)
              Indicates that the cache module board has encountered a critical
              failure.  The controller is currently operating in Zero Memory Raid
              mode.
              
            Read Cache Could Not Be Mapped (9)
              Indicates that the read cache memory in a split cache configuration 
              could not be mapped by the operating system and as a result is not 
              available. This status may be caused by virtual space limitations in

            Cache Module Board Write Errors.
            
            This shows the total number of write memory parity errors that
            were detected while writing to the Cache Module board.
            
            Write parity errors occur when the system detects that
            information has not been transferred to the Cache
            Module board correctly.  A parity bit is included for
            each byte of information stored in memory.  When the
            microprocessor reads or writes data, the system counts the
            value of the bits in each byte.  If the total does not match
            the system's expectations, a parity error has occurred.

            Array Controller Logical Drive Auto-Reliability Delay.
            
            This value indicates how many seconds the logical drive will wait
            with no requests before beginning Auto-Reliability monitoring.
            For example, the default value is five, so the logical drive will
            begin Auto-Reliability monitoring if it receives no requests for
            five seconds.  If the value is zero, the logical drive will not
            perform Auto-Reliability monitoring.  Auto-Reliability only
            operates if the logical drive is configured in one of the fault
            tolerance modes.
            
            If the logical drive receives a request while performing
            Auto-Reliability monitoring, the drive will stop monitoring to
            process the request.  Once it has satisfied all incoming requests,
            the drive will wait for the Auto-Reliability delay to expire
            before returning to Auto-Reliability monitoring.
            
            Auto-Reliability monitoring is a process to insure the highest
            level of data reliability.  In this process each disk is scanned
            to verify that all of the sectors in the drive array are
            readable.  If the Auto-Reliability monitoring process detects
            any bad sectors on the drives, it automatically remaps these
            bad sectors where possible.

            The following values are valid for the Logical Drive Fault
            Tolerance:
            
            None (2)
              Fault tolerance is not enabled.  If a physical drive reports
              an error, the data cannot be recovered by the drive array
              controller.
            
            Mirroring - RAID 1/RAID 1+0 (3)
              For each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
              containing identical data. If a drive fails, the data can be
              retrieved from the mirror drive. 
            
            Data Guard - RAID 4 (4)
              One of the physical drives is used as a data guard drive and
              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the remaining drives.
              If a failure is detected, the drive array controller rebuilds
              the data using the data guard information plus information
              from the other drives.
            
            Distributed Data Guard - RAID 5 (5)
              Distributed Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5,
              is similar to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
              information on one drive, the information is distributed across
              all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the drive array
              controller rebuilds the data using the data guard information
              from all the drives.
            
            Advanced Data Guarding - RAID 6 (7)
              Advanced Data Guarding (RAID ADG) is the fault tolerance method
              that provides the highest level of data protection.  It
              'stripes' data and parity across all the physical drives in the
              configuration to ensure the uninterrupted availability of
              uncorrupted data.  This fault-tolerance method is similar to
              distributed data guard (RAID 5) in that parity data is
              distributed across all drives in the array, except in RAID ADG
              the capacity of multiple drives is used to store parity data.
              Assuming the capacity of 2 drives is used for parity data,
              this allows continued operation despite simultaneous failure of
              any 2 drives in the array, whereas RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only
              sustain failure of a single drive.
            
            RAID 50 (8)
              Distributed data guarding (RAID 5) with multiple parity groups.
            
            RAID 60 (9)
              Advanced data guarding (RAID 6) with multiple parity groups.
              
            RAID 1 ADM (10) - Advanced Data Mirroring -  
              For each physical drive, there are two or more physical drives
              containing identical data. If a drive fails, the data can be
              retrieved from any of the mirrored drives. 
            
            RAID 10 ADM (11) - Advanced Data Mirroring with Striping - 
              For each physical drive, there are two or more physical drives
              containing identical data in addition to data being striped across
              multiple drives. If a drive fails, the data can be retrieved from 
              any of the mirrored drives.

            The logical drive can be in one of the following states:
            
            Ok (2)
              Indicates that the logical drive is in normal operation mode.
            
            Failed (3)
              Indicates that more physical drives have failed than the
              fault tolerance mode of the logical drive can handle without
              data loss.
            
            Unconfigured (4)
              Indicates that the logical drive is not configured.
            
            Recovering (5)
              Indicates that the logical drive is using Interim Recovery Mode.
              In Interim Recovery Mode, at least one physical drive has
              failed, but the logical drive's fault tolerance mode lets the
              drive continue to operate with no data loss.
            
            Ready Rebuild (6)
              Indicates that the logical drive is ready for Automatic Data
              Recovery.  The physical drive that failed has been replaced,
              but the logical drive is still operating in Interim Recovery
              Mode.
            
            Rebuilding (7)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently doing Automatic
              Data Recovery.  During Automatic Data Recovery, fault tolerance
              algorithms restore data to the replacement drive.
            
            Wrong Drive (8)
              Indicates that the wrong physical drive was replaced after a
              physical drive failure.
            
            Bad Connect (9)
              Indicates that a physical drive is not responding.
            
            Overheating (10)
              Indicates that the drive array enclosure that contains the
              logical drive is overheating.  The drive array is still
              functioning, but should be shutdown.
            
            Shutdown (11)
              Indicates that the drive array enclosure that contains the
              logical drive has overheated.  The logical drive is no longer
              functioning.
            
            Expanding (12)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently undergoing a
              transformation (expansion, shrinkage or movement). During 
              transformation, fault tolerance algorithms redistribute logical
              drive data according to the transformation operation selected.
            
            Not Available (13)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently unavailable.
              If a logical drive is expanding and the new configuration
              frees additional disk space, this free space can be
              configured into another logical volume.  If this is done,
              the new volume will be set to not available.
            
            Queued For Expansion (14)
              Indicates that the logical drive is ready for transformation 
              (expansion, shrinkage or movement). The logical drive is in the
              queue for transformation.
            
            Multi-path Access Degraded (15)
              Indicates that previously all disk drives of this logical
              drive had more than one I/O path to the controller, but now
              one or few of them have only one I/O path.
            
            Erasing (16)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently being erased.
              
            Predictive Spare Rebuild Ready (17)
              Indicates that the logical drive is ready to perform a predictive 
              spare rebuild. The logical drive is in the queue for rebuild. 
              
            Rapid Parity Initialization In Progress (18)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently undergoing rapid
              parity initialization (RPI). The logical drive is unavailable to the
              operating system during RPI and will be made available once RPI
              has completed. 
              
            Rapid Parity Initialization Pending (19)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently pending rapid
              parity initialization and will be unavailable.
              
            No Access - Encrypted - Missing Key (20)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently encrypted and cannot
              be accessed because the array controller has not yet received the 
              encryption key from iLO nor was it found in the controller's CSP 
              NVRAM.              
             
            Unencrypted to Encrypted Transformation in Progress (21)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently being transformed from
              unencrypted to encrypted and the volume is online. Data will be
              written unencrypted if the write is directed to an LBA range on the
              logical drive that has not yet been migrated.
              
            New Logical Drive Key Rekey in Progress (22)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently encrypted and all data
              is currently being rekeyed with a new logical drive key using the
              background capacity expansion transformation task. The logical drive
              is online.
              
            No Access - Encrypted with Controller Encryption Not Enabled (23)
              Indicates that the logical drive is currently encrypted and cannot
              be accessed because the array controller does not have encryption
              enabled.
              
            Unencrypted To Encrypted Transformation Not Started (24)
              Indicates that the logical drive has received a request to transform
              from unencrypted to encrypted but this process has not yet started. 
              The unencrypted logical drive is currently online.
              
            New Logical Drive Key Rekey Request Received (25)
              Indicates that the logical drive is encrypted and has received 
              a request to rekey all data with a new logical drive encryption key.

            a 32-bit value, represented by 4 octets in LSB...MSB
            (Little-Endian) order.
            
            There may be 0 or more Interface Numbers on a particular
            logical adapter, depending on the operating system's
            assignment of Interface Numbers.  There is an interface
            number field in the cpqNicIfPhysAdapterTable which may
            contain one or more interface numbers.  For logical
            adapters with one Physical Adapter, the same Interface
            Number(s) may appear in both tables.

            octets in length and do not pass the FCS check.
            The alignment of a frame is checked by the
            receiver after the packet has failed the
            Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC). Misaligned
            packets do not end on an 8-bit boundary.
            All packets contain a set number of bytes
            and must end after a defined number of bytes.
            Packets that do not end on a byte boundary
            fail the alignment check.
            
            Faulty components may be the cause of alignment
            errors. Check the following:
            
            Segment too long: Nodes at the far end of the
            cabling system transmit, unaware that a station
            at the other end has already gained control of
            the medium by transmitting the first 64 bytes
            of a frame.
            
            Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
            shorted or damaged cabling may become corrupt
            before reaching the destination station.
            
            Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
            of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
            corrupt data flow.
            
            Improper termination: If a cable segment is not
            properly terminated, allowing the signal to be
            absorbed upon reaching the end of the segment,
            a partial signal will bounce back and collide
            with existing signals.
            
            Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
            motors or other devices can distort the signals
            and cause CRC/Alignment errors.
            
            Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
            cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
            If you suspect a deaf node, replace the NIC.
            
            Failing repeater, transceiver, or controller:
            Repeaters, transceivers, and controllers can
            disrupt the network signal, transmit erroneous
            signals on the wire, or ignore incoming packets.
            Perform the following steps:
            
            1.  If your NIC is continuously transmitting,
                it causes erroneous signals, or 'jabber'.
                Replace a jabbering transmitter to ensure
                proper network performance.
            
            2.  Check your hub or switch. This component
                may be at fault.  Use the diagnostics from
                the component manufacturer to help you
                determine if a problem exists.

            collision.
            
            The carrier sense signal is an ongoing activity
            of a data station to detect whether or not another
            station is transmitting.  Carrier sense errors
            are detected when a station transmits a frame and
            does not detect its own signal on the wire.
            
            If you receive carrier sense errors, check the
            following:
            
            Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
            shorted or damaged cabling may cause a signal loss.
            Ensure that your cable is working and plugged in
            properly.
            
            Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
            of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
            interrupt the signal.  Ensure that you have
            properly grounded all segments.
            
            Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
            motors or other devices can interrupt the signals.
            
            Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
            cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
            If you suspect a deaf node, the network interface
            card should be replaced.
            
            Failing hub, switch, or controller: Repeaters,
            switches and controllers can disrupt the network
            signal, transmit erroneous signals on the wire,
            or ignore incoming packets.  Perform the following
            steps:
            
            1.  Swap out the adapter, adapter cable, and
                adapter attachment point, one at a time.

            The number of packets deferred before transmission:
            This counter contains the number of packets whose
            transmission was delayed on its first attempt
            because the medium was busy.  Packets involved
            in any collisions are not counted.  Frames
            that wait before transmission are counted.
            This statistic will be incremented often during
            normal operation on a busy network.
            
            Deferred transmissions occur when the network
            is extremely busy; so busy that the NIC did
            not try to transmit.  High counts of multiple
            collisions and excessive collisions also occur.
            
            Deferred transmissions indicate that this segment
            of the LAN is overcrowded.  Reduce the traffic
            by reorganizing the LAN.  For example, if you
            have 100 stations on one Ethernet bus, break it
            into two Ethernet segments by adding a NIC to
            your server.  In this way you can balance the
            load by putting 50 stations on one segment and
            50 on the other.  If a few isolated stations
            create the traffic, put them on a separate segment.

            The number of packets aborted during transmission
            due to excessive collisions: This counter contains
            the number of packets that, due to excessive
            collisions, are not transmitted successfully.
            A station may attempt to transmit up to 16 times
            before it must abort the attempt.  Once the abort
            occurs, this counter increments.
            
            If you see an increase in deferred transmissions
            as well as excessive collisions, the network is
            extremely busy and this segment of the LAN is
            overcrowded.  Reduce the traffic by reorganizing
            your LAN or adding a NIC to the server.  For example,
            if you have 100 stations on one Ethernet bus, break
            it into two Ethernet buses by adding a NIC to your
            server.   In this way you can balance the load by
            putting 50 stations on one bus and 50 on the other.
            If there are a few isolated stations creating the
            traffic, try placing them on a separate bus.
            
            Faulty components may be the cause of excessive
            collisions. Check the following:
            
            Segment too long: Nodes at the far end of the
            cabling system transmit, unaware that a station
            at the other end has already gained control of
            the medium by transmitting the first 64 bytes
            of a frame.
            
            Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
            shorted or damaged cabling may become corrupt
            before reaching the destination station.
            
            Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
            of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
            corrupt data flow.
            
            Improper termination: If a cable segment is not
            properly terminated, allowing the signal to be
            absorbed upon reaching the end of the segment,
            a partial signal will bounce back and collide
            with existing signals.
            
            Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
            motors or other devices can distort the signals
            and cause CRC/Alignment errors.
            
            Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
            cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
            If you suspect a deaf node, replace the NIC.
            
            Failing repeater, transceiver, or controller:
            Repeaters, transceivers, and controllers can
            disrupt the network signal, transmit erroneous
            signals on the wire, or ignore incoming packets.
            Perform the following steps:
            
            1.  If your NIC is continuously transmitting,
                it causes erroneous signals, or 'jabber.'
                Replace a jabbering transmitter to ensure
                proper network performance.
            
            2.  Check your hub or switch. This component
                may be at fault.  Use the diagnostics from
                the component manufacturer to help you
                determine if a problem exists.

            Late collisions may be a symptom of cabling
            problems.  A late collision is one that occurred
            64 bytes or more into the packet.
            
            Late collisions may be an indication that a
            segment is longer than allowed by the wiring
            specifications.
            
            A station will believe it has control of the
            cable segment if it has already transmitted 64
            bytes.  If another node at the far end of the
            segment has not yet seen the packet, and transmits,
            this packet will collide with the first
            transmission after the first 64 bytes have been
            sent.  Ensure that your segment length does not
            exceed the maximum length allowed.
            
            Because the location of cabling problems can be very
            difficult to detect on an Ethernet network, you may
            want to 'shorten' an Ethernet segment (remove portions
            of the network to isolate problems) until the problems
            are no longer seen, and then expand the network until
            the problem recurs.
            
            If this counter increments quickly in a short
            period of time, it may mean that the network
            card is running in half duplex mode, but your
            hub or switch port is configured for full duplex
            mode.  Compare your network card's configuration
            with the port's configuration.
            
            Late collisions are also included in other
            collision-related statistics.

              The adapter is the primary adapter in the group, or the
              group consists of a single adapter.  The primary adapter
              in a Single Pair or NFT group handles all the network
              traffic unless it fails.  The primary adapter in an ALB
              group receives all traffic.  The physical address of
              this adapter is the default address of the group.  In
              a FEC group, an arbitrary adapter is designated as
              primary, but all adapters are equal and participate
              fully on the network.
            
            secondary(3)
              In Single Pair and NFT groups, this adapter functions as a
              hot standby.  No network traffic is handled by this adapter
              other than periodic test packets.
              In an ALB group, this adapter is in a secondary role and
              transmits packets to increase bandwidth.
              In an FEC group, this adapter participates fully in network
              traffic.

              traffic.
              
            TxRx(5)
              The adapter can transmit and receive.
              
            Tx(6)
              The adapter can only transmit.

              The temperature sensor exceeded the critical threshold value,

            sensor will be considered to be in a tripped state this
            causing some action to occur depending on the type of

            information from the device driver.  A frequency of zero (0)
            indicates that the Insight Agent retrieves the information upon

            SCSI Logical Drive Condition.
            
            This is the overall condition of the logical drive and all of the
            physical drives which comprise it.
            The following values are defined:
            
            other(1)
              The management agent does not recognize the status.  You may
              need to upgrade your software.
            
            ok(2)
              The logical drive and all of its physical drives are operating
              normally.  No user action is required.
            
            degraded(3)
              Either the logical drive is degraded or one or more of its
              physical drives is degraded.  You need to check the status
              of the logical drive and of all its physical drives.
            
            failed(4)
              Either the logical drive has failed or one or more of its
              physical drives has failed.  You need to check the status
              of the logical drive and of all its physical drives.

            SCSI Logical Drive Fault Tolerance.
            
            This shows the fault tolerance mode of the logical drive.
            
            The following values are valid for the Logical Drive
            Fault Tolerance:
            
            other(1)
              The management agent does not recognize the status.
              You may need to upgrade your software.
            
            none(2)
              Fault tolerance is not enabled. If a physical drive reports an
              error, the data cannot be recovered. This is known as RAID 0.
            
            mirroring(3)
              For each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
              containing identical data.  If a drive fails, the data can be
              retrieved from the mirror drive.
            
            dataGuard(4)
              One of the physical drives is used as a data guard drive and
              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the remaining drives.
              If a failure is detected, the data is rebuilt using the data
              guard information plus information from the other drives.
            
            distribDataGuard(5)
              Distributed Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5, is
              similar to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
              information on one drive, the information is distributed across
              all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the data is
              rebuilt using the data guard information from all the drives.
            
            enhancedMirroring(6)
              This is used when there are more than 2 physical disks. Each
              'mirrored stripe' is written to a disk and is mirrored to an
              'adjacent' disk. This is commonly referred to as RAID 1E.
              If a failure is detected, the data is rebuilt using the data
              from the mirrored stripes on the other drives.

               UNLOAD CPQDSKSA
               LOAD CPQDSKSA /U<time>
            
            The parameter /U specifies the frequency of updates in seconds.
            The variable <time> represents the number of seconds that the
            NLM should wait before collecting new data.  The minimum is one
            second and the maximum value is 300 seconds (five minutes).

            SCSI Physical Drive Recovered Write Errors.
            
            This is the number of write requests that the drive had to use
            retries or other recovery mechanisms on to recover data during
            the service time (phyDrvServiceHours).
            
            Retry corrected writes will occasionally occur over time.
            Having a large number of retry corrected errors does not
            necessarily indicate that the drive is failing.  However, you
            may wish to replace a drive with an abnormally high amount in
            comparison to other similiar drives as a precaution.

            Disks require time to gain momentum and reach operating speed.
            As cars are tested to go from 0 mph to 60 mph in x number of
            seconds, drive manufacturers have preset expectations for the
            time it takes the drive to spin to full speed.  Drives that do
            not meet these expectations may have problems.
            
            If the drive is having problems spinning up, this value will
            increase over time.  Eventually, the drive may fail to spin up

            Time-outs may occasionally occur when a device fails to process a
            request because the SCSI bus was busy.  If this value should rise
            dramatically, you may have a problem.  Check if you have any
            non-disk SCSI devices, like tape drives, on the SCSI bus with
            the drives.  Sometimes a non-disk device can hold onto the SCSI
            bus for long periods of time causing time-outs.

            This shows the number of sectors of the reallocation area that
            have been used by the physical drive over the life of the drive.
            
            Because of the nature of magnetic disks, certain sectors on a
            drive may have media defects. The reallocation area is part of
            the disk drive that the drive manufacturer sets aside to
            compensate for these defects. The drive writes information
            addressed from these unusable sectors to available sectors in
            the reallocation area.
            
            If all of the reserved sectors have been used, then there is
            no way for the drive to remap bad sectors and the drive will
            start failing.  Unfortunately, the number of reallocation
            sectors originally reserved for this purpose is drive specific
            and you must contact the drive vendor for these values.
            
            If the current value starts to approach the maximum reserved you
            may wish to replace the drive before it fails.

          description: |+
            SCSI Device Negotiated Period.
            
            This is the amount of time that was negotiated between the
            controller and the device as a synchronous transfer window.
            A synchronous transfer window is how long the device can
            transfer data without requiring an acknowledgment from the
            controller.  In general the larger the negotiated period is,
            the lower the device throughput.  This value is reported in
            quarters of nanoseconds.

            SCSI Device Bus Parity Errors.
            
            This is the number of parity errors seen on the SCSI bus while
            processing commands for this SCSI ID.  This value is maintained
            since the SCSI Hardware Interface driver was loaded.
            
            Parity errors may occasionally occur.  If this value should rise
            dramatically, you may have a problem.  Some common causes include
            radio frequency interference (RFI) on the bus cables, bad or
            missing terminating resisters on the drives or having more than
            one device with the same SCSI ID.  Insure the bus cable is free
            of obstructions and that the devices on the bus are properly
            configured.

          description: |+
            SCSI Device Bus Phase Errors.
            
            This is the number of times the SCSI bus entered an invalid
            operating state while processing commands for the SCSI ID.
            This value is maintained since the SCSI Hardware Interface driver
            was loaded.
            
            If you see any phase errors you may have a problem.
            Phase errors can be caused by a device which is not operating
            correctly.  If the phase errors continue to increase the device
            should be replaced.

            This is the number of times the controller attempted to start
            communications with a device by selecting it but the device did
            not respond.
            
            If you see any select time-outs you may have a problem.  The device
            may have hung during operations.  The SCSI controller will attempt
            to reset the device but if this value continues to increment you
            may need to power cycle the device.

             defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted
             least significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in
             contrast to other 802.x protocols) requires MAC addresses
             to be transmitted most significant bit first.
            
             16-bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting
             their upper 4 octets to all 0's, i.e., AAFF would be
             represented as 00000000AAFF.

            This feature can be enabled or disabled through the Collection
            Agent User Interface (CPQCAUI.NLM).
            
            You may want to disable the Async Communication with the Server
            Manager to prevent a Server Manager Facility (SMF) user from
            assuming control of the system console.  Disabling the Async
            Communication disconnects any active SMF session.   Disabling the
            Async Communications also disables all remote alerts.  Server
            Manager On-the-Network alerts will remain enabled. On-the-Network
            alerts are those sent over the network.

            The EISA slot data for the board in this slot.
            
            This octet string contains the following EISA slot information:
            
            The first octet will be zero (0) if this slot contains a
            properly configured board.  Any other value indicates that the
            EISA configuration information for this board is invalid or an
            error occurred when trying to retrieve the information.
            
            The second octet contains several bit flags about the product ID
            and slot type.
            
                Bit 7:      0 = No duplicate ID
                            1 = Duplicate IDs
            
                Bit 6:      0 = Product ID readable
                            1 = Product ID not readable
            
                Bit 5,4:    00 = Expansion slot
                            01 = Embedded device
                            10 = Virtual device
                            11 = Reserved
            
                Bit 3..0:   This nibble indicates which CFG file is loaded
                            when duplicate file names are present.
                            0000 = No duplicate ID
                            0001 = First duplicate ID
                            0010 = Second duplicate ID
                            0011 = Third duplicate ID
                              .
                              .
                              .
                            1111 = Fifteenth duplicate ID
            
            NOTE:   Bit 7 is the most significant bit, bit 0 is the least
                    significant.
            
            The third octet contains the major revision level of the
            configuration utility.
            
            The fourth octet contains the minor revision level of the
            configuration utility.
            
            The fifth octet contains the most significant byte of the
            configuration file checksum.
            
            The sixth octet contains the least significant byte of the
            configuration file checksum.
            
            The seventh octet contains the number of device functions defined
            for the board in this slot.
            
            The eighth octet contains the combined function information.
            This is a set of flags.  Each bit has the following meaning when
            set (1):
                Bit 7:  reserved (0)
                Bit 6:  slot has one or more free form data entries
                Bit 5:  slot has one or more port initialization entries.
                Bit 4:  slot has one or more port range entries.
                Bit 3:  slot has one or more DMA entries.
                Bit 2:  slot has one or more interrupt (IRQ) entries.
                Bit 1:  slot has one or more memory entries.
                Bit 0:  slot has one or more function type definitions.
            
            NOTE:   bit 7 is the most significant bit, bit 0 is the least
                    significant.
            
            The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth octets contain the four
            byte compressed EISA ID.
            
            For more information about the meaning of this information

            part of the same processor unit.  For example, If a processor
            board contained a Intel 80386 processor with both a Intel 80387
            and a Weitek 3167, both the 80387 and the 3167 would have the
            same fpuUnitIndex (which would match the 80386's cpuUnitIndex)
            but the 80387 and the 3167 would have different fpuChipIndex
            field values.

            If the sample type (cpqMeAlarmSampleType) is

            the previous sampled value is less than or equal to
            the threshold (cpqMeAlarmFallingThreshold), and the

            This string is used to model an administratively
            assigned name of the owner of a resource. This
            information is taken from the NVT ASCII character set.
            It is suggested that this name contain one or more
            of the following:
            IP address, management station name, network manager's
            name, location, or phone number.
            In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
            an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
            to a string starting with 'monitor'.
            
            SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of
            the contents of MIB views; access to a particular SNMP
            object instance depends only upon its presence or
            absence in a particular MIB view and never upon its
            value or the value of related object instances. Thus,
            objects of this type afford resolution of resource
            contention only among cooperating managers; they
            realize no access control function with respect
            to uncooperative parties.

            If the sample type (cpqMeAlarmSampleType) is

            If cpqMeAlarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or

            The status of this alarm entry.
            
            Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
            effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
            That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
            identified with said entry.
            It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
            the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
            Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
            receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
            to entries currently not in use.  Proper
            interpretation of such entries requires examination
            of the relevant cpqMeAlarmStatus object.
            
            An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
            createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
            createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
            this object is created, the agent may wish to create
            supplemental object instances to complete a conceptual
            row in this table.  Immediately after completing the
            create operation, the agent must set this object to
            underCreation(3).
            
            Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
            the management station is finished configuring the
            entry and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts,
            setting this object to invalid(4).  The agent will
            deny a request to modify an underCreation(3) entry to
            be that of createRequest(2) in order to lessen problems
            arising when multiple management stations may be trying
            to add an entry with the same index.  If the agent
            determines that an entry has been in the
            underCreation(3) state for an abnormally long time,
            it may decide that the management station has
            crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
            it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
            entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
            management station may need to wait for human input
            and will allow for that possibility in its
            determination of this abnormally long period.
            
            If the agent has an entry which is valid(4) and it
            is unable to query the particular ASN.1 object specified,
            the agent should set the status to tempUnavailable(5).
            The agent should continue to query that ASN.1 object,
            and upon a successful query, the agent should set the
            status back to valid(4).

            If the sample type (cpqMeAlarmSampleType) is
            deltaValue(2), the value (cpqMeAlarmValue) should
            become the most recently sampled value minus the

            Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely

            in a particular MIB view.  Because there is thus no
            acceptable means of restricting the read access that
            could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the
            agent must only grant write access to this object in
            those views that have read access to all objects on
            the agent.
            
            During a set operation, if the supplied variable
            name is not available in the selected MIB view, a

            This table represents the managed nodes's knowledge of the
            IP addressed configured on the other cluster members.
            This provides a hint for reaching the other members, and
            a low-level mechanism for identifying members of the same
            cluster.
            
            Note that the managed node's addressing information is already
            available in ipAddrTable, so is not required to be present in
            this table
