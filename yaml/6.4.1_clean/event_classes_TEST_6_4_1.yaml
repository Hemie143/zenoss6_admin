Cause: The maximum hop count was exceeded for this message. This non-delivery report can also be caused if a looping condition exists between sending and receiving servers that are not in the same Exchange organization. In this situation, the message bounces back and forth until the hop count is exceeded. A configuration error in the e-mail system can also cause the message to bounce between two servers or to be forwarded between two recipients. Solution: The maximum hop count is a property set on each virtual server and you can manually override it. The default maximum hop count is 15. Also, check for any situations that might cause loops between servers.'

        example: snmp trap cpqNic3RedundancyReduced
        evaluation: |+
          This trap will be sent any time a physical adapter in a
          logical adapter group changes to the Failed condition, but
          at least one physical adapter remains in the OK condition..
          
          This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
          removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
          adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this
          condition.
          
          User Action: Check the connection to the adapter and validate the connectivity from the server to any external device, including the cabling. If no problems are found, the adapter or other connectivity device may need replacement.

        evaluation: |+
          This trap will be sent any time the status of a logical
          adapter changes to the Failed condition.  This occurs
          when the adapter in a single adapter configuration fails,
          or when the last adapter in a redundant configuration fails.
          
          This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
          removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
          adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this
          condition.
          
          User Action: Check the cables to the adapter and the Hub or
          Switch.  If no cable problems are found, the adapter, Hub,

        evaluation: |+
          This trap will be sent any time connectivity is restored
          to a logical adapter.  This occurs when the physical
          adapter in a single adapter configuration returns to
          the OK condition or at least one physical adapter
          in a logical adapter group returns to the OK condition.

          This trap will be sent any time a previously failed physical
          adapter in a connected logical adapter group returns to the OK
          condition.  This trap is not sent when a logical adapter
          group has connectivity restored from a Failed condition.  The
          cpqNicConnectivityRestored trap is sent instead.
          
          This can be caused by replacement of a faulty cable

        example: snmp trap cpqSmAlertDestinationBlacklisted
        evaluation: |+
          Alert destination blacklisted.
          
          The Server Manager board modem has blacklisted an alert 
          destination phone number.  Once blacklisted, that alert 
          destination is no longer available for use as an alert 
          destination.  Blacklisting, which only occurs in 
          international modems, is a requirement imposed by certain 
          European countries on modems, to prevent a phone number 
          from being dialed multiple times without getting a connection.  
          The number of attempts required to have blacklisting occur,
           vary from country to country.  Once an alert destination has 
           been blacklisted, the only way to remove the blacklisted phone 
           number is to remove power from the modem.  
           On external modems this is a trival task.  When a blacklisting
           occurs on the Server Manager board's internal modem the
           task is slightly more difficult as the modem gets power 
           from the Server Manager board.  
           To remove power from the Server Manager board's internal modem,
           the Server Manager board must be forced into Dormant Mode.
           This is an operating mode, used to conserve battery life,
           which is entered automatically if the board looses power.
           To cause the board to enter Dormant Mode, the following
           steps should be performed:
             1) Disable alerting via CPQCAUI.NLM.
             2) Disable async communication via CPQCAUI.NLM.
             3) Down the server.
             4) Exit to DOS (if applicable).
             5) Shut power off to the computer.
             6) Wait 5 minutes before restoring power.
           Once the 5 minutes has expired, and power to the computer
           has been restored, the modem will have flushed its
           blacklist, and the board's alerting functions will work
           as expected.

          View the synchronization log on this server for details of what failed during synchronization. To view the synchronization log, go to the Software Update Services Admin Web site (http://<YourServerName>/SUSAdmin), and click the View synchronization log link. (Error 0x80190197: HTTP error 407. Proxy authentication required.)
          
          
          
          User Action 
          
          Try synchronizing the server again to see if the error occurs again. To synchronize the server, go to the Software Update Services Admin Web site, and click the Synchronize server link. Then click the Synchronize Now button.
          
          
          
          Additional Data
          
          The most common reason for failed synchronization is incorrect proxy server configuration. If you are using a proxy server, please confirm your configuration by going to the Software Update Services Admin Web site and clicking the Set options link. Confirm your configuration in the results pane.
